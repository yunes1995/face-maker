# Face-Maker
Hi guys! I come back with new project :)
In this project that I did, we have a cartoon character where you can change its body color and choose different faces for it.
Horns and tails can be determined for it and its color can be changed.
The color of the main screen can also be changed in a very cool way.
I have put the GitHub link of this project for you.
I put the video in this post for you.
